Presence Simulator automatically replays your lighting patterns from exactly one week ago, simulating your presence at home. The app tracks when your lights, sockets, and switches turn on and off throughout the week, then replays these exact patterns when you enable simulation mode - turning devices on and off at the same times as one week prior.

Perfect for vacations or when away from home. Simply select the devices you want to track in the app settings, let it record for a week, and enable simulation mode when needed. For faster setup, you can optionally import up to 50 recent on/off events from Homey Insights when adding devices. The visual timeline and event history help you review patterns before activating the simulation.
