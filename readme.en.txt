Presence Simulator automatically replays your lighting patterns from exactly one week ago, simulating your presence at home.

The app tracks when your lights turn on and off throughout the week. When you enable simulation mode, it replays these patterns automatically - turning lights on and off at the same times as one week prior.

FEATURES
- Automatically tracks your lighting devices without manual configuration
- Replays patterns from exactly one week ago (same day, same time)
- Visual timeline showing your weekly lighting patterns per device
- Event history to review when lights were turned on/off
- Simple enable/disable simulation mode
- Smart filtering: only shows lights, sockets, and compatible groups
- Group support: automatically handles individual devices when tracking groups
- Import history: quickly import up to 50 events from Homey Insights
- Test mode available for hourly replay during testing

HOW IT WORKS
1. Add the devices you want to track in the app settings
2. The app automatically records when these devices turn on/off
3. Enable "Simulation Mode" when desired
4. Your devices will turn on/off exactly as they did one week ago

PERFECT FOR
- Simulating presence during vacations
- Maintaining regular patterns when away
- Automating your lighting based on your actual behavior
